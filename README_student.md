# Welcome to Gif A Cat

Thank you for viewing our CLI application! This was very fun school project at Flatiron School.

#About the CLI Application

The following CLI application utilizes a Giphy API to help users search for cool cat gifs in there terminal. The application is fully interactive and even allows you to save favorite cat gifs.
The application was created by Joyce Kwon and Matthew Doering.

#Updates will be needed...v1.0

The application is a first draft and needs to be refactored to account for more edge cases as well as clean up methods that have repeating code.
